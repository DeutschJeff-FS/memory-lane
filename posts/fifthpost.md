&emsp;It used to be when you wanted to develop for mobile, you had to learn the language respective to the os you wanted to develop for: Objective-C (now called Swift) for iOS and Java/Kotlin for Android. Today, that's still the case, if you want to develop solely for an os. Now, though, you can develop cross-platform: meaning you can write your code in one language and it works across all devices and systems. Today, the main technologies employed to develop for mobile are React Native, Flutter, and Xamarin. But only one is a clear winner.
&emsp;In terms of popularity, community support, programming language, and development time, React Native comes out on top. React Native is built on top of JavaScript, which is a vastly popular, if not THE most popular, programming language. Because of this, it's very popular, has a large support community, and fast development time. Flutter is built from Google's Dart language. While not as popular, it has been growing in both popularity and support. It also wins out over React Native in terms of performance (because Dart is a compiled language, making it faster that React Native using JavaScript), architecture, and user interface. Xamarin is built on top of C#, which has a bit of a learning curve to it, but it is gaining in popularity and support as well.
