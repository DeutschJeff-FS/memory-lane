You're given a mockup of a site to build. You've built the skeleton of the site, but how do you style it? There are quite a few ways to do so, but let's talk about a few: CSS, Tailwind, and styled-components. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, allows you to code out all of your elements in one file, but this can become a little difficult to debug, especially as the number of lines of code increase. Tailwind allows for more inline styling on an HTML page, but again, this can be just as difficult to debug as you have tens of classes per element for styling.
