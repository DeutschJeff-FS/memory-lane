You're given the task of creating a site for a company. Before you can start coding, you need to understand all the requirements needed for the task. Once you know all of that, then you have to choose all the right technologies that fit all the necessary requirements. If you're building just a basic site, some informational, you can build it from scratch with a number of tech like React, Angular, or even more simply, HTML, plus whatever tech you will use for styling, such as CSS or styled-components. If you're showcasing products, then using something like Shopify might be better suited. Much like the amount of technologies to choose from, your list of requirements is both ever-evolving and not exhaustive.
