When trying to determine the structure of the site you're building on the front-end, there are several options to choose from. You can build it entirely from HTML, laying every single block of content out on the page all at once. OR...you can build your site from React. React allows you to build reusable components that can be customized at any point while only changing the content. The trade off between HTML and React is either many lines of code on one file or many files with much less lines of code per file.
